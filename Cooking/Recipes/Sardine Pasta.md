## Description

A simple pasta recipe that uses staples and canned sardines.
## Ingredients

- [ ] 8 - 12 oz **pasta** (see [Notes](#Notes) )
- [ ] 1 - 2 cans **sardine**, packed in oil; fillets preferred; Oil is used, don't discard
- [ ] 1/2 large **onion**, diced
- [ ] 3 cloves **garlic**, smashed into a paste
- [ ] 1 - 2 cups fresh **tomato**, diced (see [Notes](#Notes) )
- [ ] 3 - 4 Tbls **red wine vinegar** or **red wine** (see [Notes](#Notes) )
- [ ] 1 tsp **dried Italian herbs**
- [ ] **Parmesan**, grated (optional)
- [ ] 1 Tbls **butter** (optional)
- [ ] **salt** or **fish sauce**

## Steps

- [ ] Prep all ingredients.
- [ ] Boil enough water to just cover the pasta. Salt the water generously and add pasta.
- [ ] Add sardines with their oil and onions into a medium hot skillet. 
- [ ] Cook until onions become translucent and mixture begins to start sticking and browning. About 5 minutes.
- [ ] Add garlic, stir to incorporate and cook for 1 minutes.
- [ ] Add tomatoes, vinegar, and dried herbs. Stir scraping up stuck on bits off the bottom of the skillet.
- [ ] Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring every minute or two to reduce the sauce. If it starts to stick to the bottom or becomes too thick, add a large ladle full of starchy pasta water to loosen the sauce. See [Notes](#Notes) about pasta water.
- [ ] When the pasta has finished cooking, add directly to the sauce in the skillet. Stir to incorporate adding pasta water to loosen as needed. 
- [ ] When the sauce has thickened into a sauce that sticks to the noodles, remove from heat. 
- [ ] Immediately add parmesan and butter, as desired, and stir to fully incorporate. 
- [ ] Taste and salt as needed then serve.

## Notes
- Pasta shapes
	- Use shapes that work will with a thickened sauce. Penne, fusilli, or other medium shapes work well. Spaghetti or linguini also work well. Very small shapes or very large shapes don't work too well.
- Tomatoes 
	- Use fresh tomatoes over diced. Cherry tomatoes work best but large tomatoes also work well.
- Deglazing Liquid
	- Deglazing liquid needs to be slightly acidic and unsalted. Red wine and red wine vinegar are preferred but other things (like lemon juice) might work as well.
- Pasta water
	- Starchy pasta water is key to making the sauce the right consistency. **Always add at least 1/2 cup of starchy pasta water** to get the sauce to a good consistency. Add more as needed but remember that the water is salted and can make the sauce too salty. 
- Butter
	- Butter makes that sauce extra smooth and luxurious, but it dampens some of the flavor. 
- Fish Sauce
	- Fish sauce is **highly** recommended as a finishing seasoning.
