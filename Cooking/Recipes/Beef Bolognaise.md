## Description
A beefy, umami rich pasta sauce.
## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 lb ground beef
- [ ] 2 carrots. diced or shredded 
- [ ] 1/2 onion, fine diced
- [ ] 1 celery stalk, fine diced
- [ ] 3 cloves of garlic, smashed into a paste
- [ ] 1/2 chicken broth (optional)
- [ ] 2 Tbls miso
- [ ] water
- [ ] 2 Tbls tomato paste
- [ ] 24 oz tomato sauce (no salt?)
- [ ] 1 - 2 tsp Italian herbs
- [ ] 1 parmesan rind (optional)
- [ ] 1 tsp sugar (optional and as needed)
- [ ] fish sauce, to taste (optional)

## Steps

- [ ] Mix miso with 1 cup of water. Set aside so miso can dissolve.
- [ ] In a stainless steel pot or pan with high walls start browning the beef with 1/4 cup of water over medium high until it becomes dark brown, starts sticking to the bottom, and is sputtering from frying in its own fat.
- [ ] Deglaze with either chicken broth or water being sure to scrape off the stuck on bits and dissolve it into the liquid. Add the carrots, celery, and onion. Again cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts sticking and sputtering. During this cooking period, ensure the miso is well dissolved in the water.
- [ ] Deglaze with the miso broth, again scraping off the stuck on bits. 
- [ ] Add garlic paste and tomato paste. Cook until thoroughly incorporated.
- [ ] Add tomato sauce, Italian herbs, and parmesan rind (if using) then simmer on low for at least 30 minutes, until it no longer taste like raw tomato sauce.
- [ ] Fish out the rind and taste. If too bitter, cook for 15 more minutes or so. If too acidic, add sugar. 
- [ ] Season with salt, miso water, or fish sauce to taste. Combine with cooked pasta using pasta water to control consistency. 

## Notes
All the veggies could easily be doubled, the meat halved, or everything but the meat doubled to adjust to whatever the food goals are.
