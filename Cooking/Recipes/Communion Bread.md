## Description

Communion Bread recipe for a large number of people (~200 pieces)

## Ingredients

### Single Batch
- **1 cup** sifted all-purpose flour
- **½ teaspoon** salt 
- **4 tablespoons** Crisco Shortening (refrigerator cold) 
- **4 tablespoons** / **2 oz** ice cold water

### Large Batch
- **9 cups** / **40.5 ounces** / **1125 grams** sifted all-purpose flour
- **4 ½ teaspoons** kosher salt 
	*or* **3 ½ teaspoons** table salt 
	*or* **23 grams** of any salt
- **16 ounces** Crisco Shortening (refrigerator cold)
- **2 1/4 cups** / **18 ounces** / **510 grams** ice cold water
## Steps

1. Preheat oven to **250°F**. 
2. In a small bowl, mix flour, salt, and Crisco together by hand or with a pastry blender until the mixture is the consistency of small granules.
3. Add water and shape the dough into a ball.
4. Lightly flour a rolling pin, as necessary, to prevent sticking to the dough.
5. Roll the dough out onto a large ungreased pastry sheet, very thin (approximately 1/8-inch thick).
6. Using a fork or a florist’s frog, prick the dough all over to prevent shrinkage when baking.
7. Using the edge of a ruler, score the dough every ¼-inch across in both directions to produce a grid of small squares. Make depressions in the dough but do not cut clear through.
8. Bake in the oven for **45 minutes to 1 hour**, depending on the oven.
9. Remove the bread before it becomes browned, but it should **not** be doughy or gummy. It should be delicate and easily broken.
10. While still warm, use a paring knife to cut along the scored lines into fairly large pieces (approximately **2 inches by 2 inches** or larger).
11. Store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator or freeze until ready to use.

## Notes
- Communion bread should **not** be kept for more than **one week** if refrigerated, as it contains no preservatives.
- This recipe makes single batch. You will need to make a double-batch each week
