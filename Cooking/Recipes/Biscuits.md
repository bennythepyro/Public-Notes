- [ ] Mix **flour**, **salt**, and **baking powder** in a bowl.

## Notes

- If doubled, only use 3 TSP / 1 TBLS of baking powder. 
- Butter can be replaced by ~100 g cold solid fat.
- Can replace buttermilk with either milk or yogurt and milk mixture of the same weight. 
- Don't roll out the dough too thin, they won't rise properly.
- ### DIY Baking Powder 
	- 1 part baking soda
	- 2 parts cream of tartar
	- 1 part corn starch
- ### Scones
	- Can add a little sugar, vanilla, and dry ingredients to make scones. Wet ingredients make the biscuit too wet.
