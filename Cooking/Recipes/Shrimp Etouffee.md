## Description

A Paul Dean recipe for a basic shrimp etouffee

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup oil 
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, plus extra flour, optional 
- 1 cup chopped yellow onion     
- 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper     
- 1 cup chopped celery     
- 3 cloves garlic, finely minced     
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper     
- 1/2 teaspoon white pepper     
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, more if desired     
- 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning     
- 1/2 cup minced green onions, plus extra for garnish     
- 1/2 cup minced fresh parsley leaves     
- 2 to 3 dashes hot sauce (recommended: Tabasco)     
- 1 (8-ounce) can clam juice     
- 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes (recommended: Ro'tel)     
- Salt (Cajun seasoning has salt already)     
- 2 pounds small or medium shrimp peeled and deveined (recommended: (31/35 size count)     
- 1/2 stick butter     
- Rice, optional     
- Diced green onions, for garnish

## Steps
Note: To make roux, use oil instead of butter, because butter burns too easily for this application.
- [ ] Whisk flour into the oil in a large heavy saucepan over low heat to form a paste. 
- [ ] Continue cooking over low heat and whisk continuously, until the mixture turns a caramel color and gives off a nutty aroma, about 15 to 20 minutes. 
- [ ] To the roux, add the onion, green pepper, celery, and garlic and cook over low heat about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are limp. 
- [ ] Add the black pepper, white pepper, cayenne pepper, Cajun seasoning, green onions, parsley, and hot sauce to taste. 
- [ ] Add 1 can clam juice and the tomatoes with their juice, stir to blend. 
- [ ] Add the salt, starting with 1 teaspoon, then add more if needed. 
- [ ] Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. 
- [ ] Add shrimp and stir. It will take about 3 minutes for shrimp to cook, don't overcook. 
- [ ] Remove from heat. Add the butter and stir; the heat from the dish will melt the butter. 
- [ ] Transfer the etouffee to a tureen, serving bowl, or if you prefer, over rice. Garnish with the green onions.
